Doubly Linked List

This file has tasks and exercises on doubly linked lists. Doubly linked list is a type of linked list that can be traversed both forward and backwards. It is a dynalic data structure that allows the programmer to:
		- Insert or delete a node at the beginning of a list
		- Insert or delete a node at the end of the list
		- Insert or delete a node at a specified ith positon
		- Reverse the entire list
		- The big advantage compared to singly LL is that traversing through the links is much much faster
