Actually, the appropriateness of a search algorithm to a search problem depends on data strucrure being searched, prior knowledge about the data. This folder contains exercises that aim to answer the following questions through code:

	* What is a search algorithm
	* What is a linear search
	* What is a binary search
	* What key factors to look at when identifying the most appropriate search engine
